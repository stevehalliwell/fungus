Behaviour Tree
==========

N.B Behaviour Tree functionality and commands are experimental. It's API may have breaking changes in the future. Your feedback and contributions are desired and extremely welcome.

Facilitates Behaviour Tree (BT) like structures and operations within Fungus. Broadly speaking BTs are common for structuring logic, in particular AI logic, when a number of sequences of actions are desired. Their shape and structure make the order and priority of a range of actions obvious. They also make the fallbacks and backup actions required in cases of error or invalid circumstanes, obvious and easy to implement. If you would like to know more check out [these] (http://aigamedev.com/open/article/behavior-trees-part1/) [links](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ChrisSimpson/20140717/221339/Behavior_trees_for_AI_How_they_work.php). They are excellent starting points.
