Move GetButtonColor out of the Command, it is ALWAYS static data
-move it to static data that is controlled by theme in the EditorSettings

Commands and potential flowchart/ui changes to support HFSM in Fungus
-a command that overrides the getconnectedblocks and use that on an update event to run
-do we 'define an enum' in the codebase?
-we look up things like monster love does

behaviour tree
-blocks need
--long running state
--return values


Optimisation pass
-need to get the tests working first so we can profile and automate test
-theres a bunch of string shit
-there's a bunch of iTween shit
-EDITOR- on scripts did load generate static list of all commands and events instead of as they are needed
-fungus messages, they could use the event distrib instead of the present method, that might be faster


Conversation should be able to do EVERYTHING that say and portrait can
-after that it should be able to do menu too


Global filter out commands
-stored in editor settings
-hide categories
-hide commands


Global command priority

-track command usage and sort by that?
-allow custom weight
-scan an existing project to determine weight?


global varaiables
-test that vars exist after a reload of scene
