Move GetButtonColor out of the Command, it is ALWAYS static data
-move it to static data that is controlled by theme in the EditorSettings
--means people can customise them if they want, that we can ship themes etc.

Simplify the use of BaseVariable, currently the VariableProperty allows us to filter by types
-but then at run time we need to baby it, this feels bad, do we add converters to baseclass that nulls or throws on errors?
--Don't think that's a good solution, but not sure what a better one is atm

Event on Block text entry list
-needs to have a text based search like command now does, prob needs more complicated drop down menu replacement

Commands and potential flowchart/ui changes to support HFSM in Fungus
-a command that overrides the getconnectedblocks and use that on an update event to run
-do we 'define an enum' in the codebase?
-we look up things like monster love does
-do we have a way of notifying a block that they are no longer being run?
--they have an on exit but that has no return or obvious means of delay
-http://fungusgames.com/forum#!/fungus-development:choosing-a-character-based/extending-conversation-seem


behaviour tree
-blocks need
--long running state
--return values

fungus messages need a param send
-doesn't need to send a message to the same flowchart, it's kinda just a call. But legacy so leave it
-want msg channels like falcon does, so we can easily replicate something like global events entirely within fungus
-clearer distinction between fungus flowchart msg and unity SendMessage


Optimisation pass
-need to get the tests working first so we can profile and automate test
-theres a bunch of string shit
-there's a bunch of iTween shit
-EDITOR- on scripts did load generate static list of all commands and events instead of as they are needed


Conversation should be able to do EVERYTHING that say and portrait can
-after that it should be able to do menu too


Global filter out commands
-stored in editor settings
-hide categories
-hide commands

Global command priority 
-default search sorting is alphabetical, that is not the most useful
-track command usage and sort by that?
-allow custom weight
-scan an existing project to determine weight?


Wait for Voiceover option with Say dialog #572
-say should pass down the time for the vo to complete to the writer
--presently writeraudio and writer and not connexted
--need to add wvo to tokens and handle it the same way as a wc
--need to be able to actually test it


optionally show variables in flowchart
-done, PR-done, PR


global varaiables
-needed so you can hook up references within other flowcharts
