Move GetButtonColor out of the Command, it is ALWAYS static data
-move it to static data that is controlled by theme in the EditorSettings
--means people can customise them if they want, that we can ship themes etc.


Event on Block text entry list
-needs to have a text based search like command now does, prob needs more complicated drop down menu replacement


FSM in Fungus
-http://fungusgames.com/forum#!/fungus-development:choosing-a-character-based/extending-conversation-seem
-need commands to get current state index or name 
-need command to change state by name or index 
-need command to check if it is transitioning
-need a callback/event and block for a state change

*do we need a context object that we pass to them?
*do the fungus commands actually just enable and disable the updates of these objects
revert changes to indent, make it indent arrays and lists instead
<<<<<<< HEAD
*consolidate all places that call a block to run so we can better control those from a BT
**some use flowchart execute, some block execute
**so the problem then is menus don't track where they are called from or when they are complete. But how would they

=======
*currently menu prevents BT from functioning in its current state as the menu has no idea what it started, but this may not be a problem as if a bt gets to the point where it needs a menu, it has probably found an action worth persuing

Optimisation pass
-need to get the tests working first so we can profile and automate test
-theres a bunch of string stuff
-there's a bunch of iTween stuff
-EDITOR- on scripts did load generate static list of all commands and events instead of as they are needed
-fungus messages, they could use the event distrib instead of the present method, that might be faster


Conversation should be able to do EVERYTHING that say and portrait can
-after that it should be able to do menu too


Global filter out commands
-stored in editor settings
-hide categories
-hide commands


Global command priority 
-default search sorting is alphabetical, that is not the most useful
-track command usage and sort by that?
-allow custom weight
-scan an existing project to determine weight?


Arrays
-want em, don't have em


flappy bird
-'modes'
--tap to flap
-scrolling layers
-pipe obstacle
--prob should have art...
--prob shouldnt move when hit
-bird
--anim rotation based on y velocity
--wing anim + gust particles
-physics or rb command


auto generate field and property get set fungus commmand
-test case is transform
-then make it do rbs
--cannot rely on static class as unity isn't doing that for Physics, but we can then test for static vs instance methods, see AID-Console
-we need to make the generator actually test it is using the correct types
-need to test it on custom types
