Move GetButtonColor out of the Command, it is ALWAYS static data
-move it to static data that is controlled by theme in the EditorSettings
--means people can customise them if they want, that we can ship themes etc.

Simplify the use of BaseVariable, currently the VariableProperty allows us to filter by types
-but then at run time we need to baby it, this feels bad, do we add converters to baseclass that nulls or throws on errors?

Event on Block
-needs to have a text based search like command now does, prob needs more complicated drop down menu replacement

Commands and potential flowchart/ui changes to suppor HFSM in Fungus
-a command that overrides the getconnectedblocks and use that on an update event to run
-do we 'define an enum' in the codebase?
-we look up things like monster love does

behaviour tree
-blocks need return values

fungus messages need a param set
-doesn't need to send a message to the same flowchart, it's kinda just a call. But legacy so leave it
-want msg channels like falcon does, so we can easily replicate something like global events entirely within fungus
-clearer distinction between fungus flowchart msg and unity SendMessage

Optimisation pass
-need to get the tests working first so we can profile and automate test
-theres a bunch of string shit
-there's a bunch of iTween shit
-EDITOR- on scripts did load generate static list of all commands and events instead of as they are needed

Converstaion should be able to do EVERYTHING that say and portrait can
-after that it should be able to do menu too

Menu should be able to shufle
-once, remembers the seed used to shuffle throughout the playsession
-eveytime, gets new random seed each time
