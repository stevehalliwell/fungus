Move GetButtonColor out of the Command, it is ALWAYS static data
-move it to static data that is controlled by theme in the EditorSettings
--means people can customise them if they want, that we can ship themes etc.


Event on Block text entry list
-needs to have a text based search like command now does, prob needs more complicated drop down menu replacement


FSM in Fungus
-http://fungusgames.com/forum#!/fungus-development:choosing-a-character-based/extending-conversation-seem
-demo tour, including update fsm and updated by command
--
-command to get number of states?
-need a callback/event and block for a state change?
*perhaps a readme.md


flowchart auto seperate / arrange blocks, prevent overlaps and order for directional flow


behaviour tree //http://aigamedev.com/open/article/behavior-trees-part1/
-should be considered experiemental and breaking changes may occur
**so the problem then is menus don't track where they are called from or when they are complete. But how would they, we eat that
*perhaps a readme.md

refactor and consolidate how blocks are called


Optimisation pass
-need to get the tests working first so we can profile and automate test
-theres a bunch of string stuff
-there's a bunch of iTween stuff
-EDITOR- on scripts did load generate static list of all commands and events instead of as they are needed
-fungus messages, they could use the event distrib instead of the present method, that might be faster


Conversation should be able to do EVERYTHING that say and portrait can
-after that it should be able to do menu too


Global filter out commands
-stored in editor settings
-hide categories
-hide commands


Global command priority 
-default search sorting is alphabetical, that is not the most useful
-track command usage and sort by that?
-allow custom weight
-scan an existing project to determine weight?


Arrays
-want em, don't have em


flappy bird
-'modes'
--tap to flap
-scrolling layers
-pipe obstacle
--prob should have art...
--prob shouldnt move when hit
-bird
--anim rotation based on y velocity
--wing anim + gust particles
-physics or rb command


auto generate field and property get set fungus commmand
-test case is transform
-then make it do rbs
--cannot rely on static class as unity isn't doing that for Physics, but we can then test for static vs instance methods, see AID-Console
-we need to make the generator actually test it is using the correct types
-need to test it on custom types

allow players to choose their pronoun
-localisation?
-becomes custom tag that is replaced? or just global var?
-maybe redundant, if creator wanted to they could already use var replacement for it


Say & menu to support similar optional words/phrases as Ink


Dynamic Say
-better name
-choose from 1 of many lines to say
