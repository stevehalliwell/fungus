Move GetButtonColor out of the Command, it is ALWAYS static data
-move it to static data that is controlled by theme in the EditorSettings
--means people can customise them if they want, that we can ship themes etc.


Event on Block text entry list
-needs to have a text based search like command now does, prob needs more complicated drop down menu replacement


Commands and potential flowchart/ui changes to support HFSM in Fungus
-a command that overrides the getconnectedblocks and use that on an update event to run
-do we 'define an enum' in the codebase?
-we look up things like monster love does
-do we have a way of notifying a block that they are no longer being run?
--they have an on exit but that has no return or obvious means of delay
-http://fungusgames.com/forum#!/fungus-development:choosing-a-character-based/extending-conversation-seem


behaviour tree
-blocks need
--long running state
--return values


Optimisation pass
-need to get the tests working first so we can profile and automate test
-theres a bunch of string stuff
-there's a bunch of iTween stuff
-EDITOR- on scripts did load generate static list of all commands and events instead of as they are needed
-fungus messages, they could use the event distrib instead of the present method, that might be faster


Conversation should be able to do EVERYTHING that say and portrait can
-after that it should be able to do menu too


Global filter out commands
-stored in editor settings
-hide categories
-hide commands


Global command priority 
-default search sorting is alphabetical, that is not the most useful
-track command usage and sort by that?
-allow custom weight
-scan an existing project to determine weight?


global varaiables
-test that vars exist after a reload of scene
-currently there is no way of knowing if a global exists until runtime, is this tolerable?
--we could have a single global resource for this and expose that to all, the workflow of adding vars to that that are global and not being able to see that those in your var list seems worse than not knowing your globals


Arrays
-want em, don't have em


flappy bird
-'modes'
--tap to flap
-scrolling layers
-pipe obstacle
--prob should have art...
--prob shouldnt move when hit
-bird
--anim rotation based on y velocity
--wing anim + gust particles
-physics or rb command


auto generate field and property get set fungus commmand
-test case is transform
-then make it do rbs
--cannot rely on static class as unity isn't doing that for Physics, but we can then test for static vs instance methods, see AID-Console
