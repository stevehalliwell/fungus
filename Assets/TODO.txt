Move GetButtonColor out of the Command, it is ALWAYS static data
-move it to static data that is controlled by theme in the EditorSettings
--means people can customise them if they want, that we can ship themes etc.


Event on Block text entry list
-needs to have a text based search like command now does, prob needs more complicated drop down menu replacement


FSM in Fungus
-http://fungusgames.com/forum#!/fungus-development:choosing-a-character-based/extending-conversation-seem
-demo tour, including update fsm and updated by command
*perhaps a readme.md
-better example

flowchart auto seperate / arrange blocks, prevent overlaps and order for directional flow




Optimisation pass
-need to get the tests working first so we can profile and automate test
-theres a bunch of string stuff
-there's a bunch of iTween stuff
-EDITOR- on scripts did load generate static list of all commands and events instead of as they are needed
-fungus messages, they could use the event distrib instead of the present method, that might be faster


Conversation should be able to do EVERYTHING that say and portrait can
-audio is a problem
-would be nice to be able to do menus too


Global filter out commands
-stored in editor settings
-hide categories
-hide commands


Global command priority 
-default search sorting is alphabetical, that is not the most useful
-track command usage and sort by that?
-allow custom weight
-scan an existing project to determine weight?


Arrays
-want em, don't have em


writer to support similar optional words/phrases as Ink
-https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md#6-variable-text
-use [|] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2403122/regular-expression-to-extract-text-between-square-brackets
-needs to track variation history VariationHistory
--variation only gets the line, can use hashes but might result in collisions due to duplication of lines
---do i care?
-menus should also do that


Dynamic Say
-better name
-choose from 1 of many lines to say
-localisation and VO


genvar
-need to support static class properties generation
-for an existing generated class, grab the enum and inject that to start with so we don't change index of existing variables
--handle use of deprecated vars


behaviour tree //http://aigamedev.com/open/article/behavior-trees-part1/
-should be considered experiemental and breaking changes may occur
**so the problem then is menus don't track where they are called from or when they are complete. But how would they, we eat that
*perhaps a readme.md
better BT example
