**Clickable Sprite**:
A 2D image on screen that has been code to do something when clicked with the mouse or selected by the trackpad.

<!-- ******************************* -->
**Coding / Scripting**:

<!-- ******************************* -->
**Command property panel**:
When a Block is selected in a %Fungus Flowchart, the top-half of the Inspector window will show the properties and list of Commands for that Block. When one of the Commands is selected, that its properties are displayed in the bottom-half of the Inspector window.


<!-- ******************************* -->
**Condition**:
Conditions are tests that are either "TRUE" or "FALSE" at a particular point in time. Different Commands can be defined to be executed depending on the value of a condition test in a %Fungus Block.

**CSV**:
Comma Separated Variable - a computer file format where the values of rows and columns are recorded, in a form that can be loaded into a spreadsheet..


<!-- ******************************* -->
**Custom strings**:
As well as the automatically generated rows for each Say, Menu, Command etc., you can also add your own rows to the localisation file using any string id you want. To use these custom strings, you use variable substitution.

For example, say you have a custom string called "PlayerName", you can put {$PlayerName} in any Say text to substitute the correct localised value from the localisation file.

**Flowchart Localization id**:
A special, unique name, used for associating language localization data for each %Fungus game project.

<!-- ******************************* -->
**Flowchart Message**:
A Message is basically a piece of text, but one that plays the role of being able to act as a 'trigger event' to cause Blocks to start executing.

Messages can be sent (via the ```Flow | Send Message``` Command), either to the current Flowchart, or to **ALL** Flowcharts. One of the Events that can be defined to start the execution of a Block is if a particular Message has been received by the Flowchart.

<!-- ******************************* -->

The Set Language command is provided with the name of the column for the language you wish to use in %Fungus.

<!-- ******************************* -->
**Logging**:
The  ```Scripting | Debug Log``` Command allows the writing ('logging') of messages to the Console window while a scene is running. Logs provide a record of what has happened when the game is running, useful for checking what happened was what was intended, or for debugging (hunting down where errors are located).

<!-- ------------------------ -->
<!-- ---------- S ----------- -->
<!-- ------------------------ -->

## S



<!-- ******************************* -->
**Save profile**:
The Save Profile is basically a string that gets prepended to the key used to save & load variables in PlayerPrefs. This allows you to create  separate save profiles using different names. For example, player 1's save data might use the Save Profile 'Chris', while player 2's data would use the Save Profile 'Matt', and their data can be saved / loaded independently.

The typical workflow would be:

1. Choose a suitable value fo the Save Profile (e.g. "player1")

2. Set Save Profile.

3. Save Variable(s).


<!-- ******************************* -->
**Say Dialog**:
The UI elements (background / lines / text) that define the visual style of how the Story Text of Say Commands is presented to the user.

![story text output](./images/010_say_command/4_scene_running.png "story text output")


%Fungus provides a default Say Dialog, but custom variations can be defined, for different games / scenes / characters etc.

<!-- ******************************* -->
**Scenes**:
Unity Scenes are like chapters in a book, or "screens" in a game, or "levels" in a game. They allow the logic of a computer game to be broken into components. The "gameObjects" in a scene determine what software components will be created when a Scene starts running (others may be created or deleted once the Scene has started).

<!-- ******************************* -->
**Screen aspect ratio**:
The relationship of the width of an image or screen to its height. Typical rations include 4:3 ad 16:10.

<!-- ******************************* -->
**Screen resolution**:
The number of pixels wide and high a window or device supports.

<!-- ******************************* -->
**Sorting layer**:
Unity 2D objects are assigned to a "Sorting Layer". This allows images/text to be assigned to layers such as Background, Foreground, Middleground, UI (on top of everything) etc.

<!-- ******************************* -->
**Spine**:
Spine is a third-party 2D animation system from [EsotericSoftware.com].

<!-- ******************************* -->
**Spine Animation**:
Animation clip based on the Spine 2D system, that can be controlled from %Fungus Commands (once  the Unity Spine and %Fungus Spine add-on packages have been installed).


<!-- ******************************* -->
**Sprites**:
2D Images, that may be hidden / revealed. Sprite may be moved through %Fungus Commands, or Unity code. Sprites can also be defined to be "draggable" by the users computer mouse pointer or mobile device touch gestures.


<!-- ******************************* -->
**Stage**:
A %Fungus gameObject in the scene, used to define the position and start-end movements of Character Portrait images controlled by %Fungus Portrait Commands.

<!-- ******************************* -->
**Standard block**:
A %Fungus Block whose execution is **not** triggered by an event (so it is not an Event Block), and which does **not** cause the execution of 2 or more other Blocks (so is **not** a Branching Block).

Note: Standard Blocks are displayed as yellow rectangles in the Flowchart window.

![standard block](./images/001_3_block_types/3_standard_block.png "standard block")


<!-- ******************************* -->
**Standard Text**:
When you export the localization file, there is a Standard Text field. This is populated with the text that has been entered into the Say, Menu, etc. text fields in the Unity editor. In normal usage, this field is in the localisation file for reference so localizers know what text needs to be translated. For example, if the project is drafted using English, then the text in Say, Menu Commands etc. would be in English, and in the exported localization file this text would appear in the Standard Text fields.

Note, if you use the Set Language command with an empty language string then the values in the Standard Text field will be used when %Fungus runs.


<!-- ******************************* -->
**Story Text Tags**:
Special instructions that can be embedded inside the Story Text of Say commands. Examples are tags that start/stop playing a sound, or send a message.



<!-- ******************************* -->
**String ID**:
This is an automatically generated ID code, that is stored in the first column of the localisation file. These IDs are generated automatically when you export the strings using the Localization object.

The ID is needed since every localised text string needs a unique identifying name so that it can be mapped it back to the Say, Menu, etc. command that references it.

<!-- ******************************* -->
**String variable**:
A variable that stores text characters, such as the player's name, or colour of the potion they are carrying.

**Variable default value**:
A "default" value refers to the value given to a variable automatically, if no particular value is specified. In the Variables section at the bottom of the Flowchart window, as well as defining the names and data types of variables, you can also set default values here.

![default variable value](./images/001_variables/1_default_values.png "default variable value")

**Variables Panel**:
The very bottom section of the Flowchart window is where variables (such as score, playerName, carryingGreenKey etc.) can be defined for use in %Fungus Commands.

<!-- ******************************* -->
**Variable saving**:
The saving of the value of a variable to the devices 'disk'. So when another Unity Scene is loaded, the saved value can be loaded from saved memory. The saved value can also be loaded the next time the game application is executed on a device.
